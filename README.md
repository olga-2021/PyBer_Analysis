# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities (urban, suburban, rural) in which Pyber operates. Creating a multiple-line graph of rideshare data that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

- Urban cities have the highest ridership demand with a total fare of $39,854.38, a total number of drivers of 2405, and total rides of 1625. Therefore, in the Urban area is the minimum average fare per ride which is $24.53 and minimum average fare per drivee which is $16.57. 
- As a comparison, rural cities have the lowest ridership demand with a number of total fares of $4,327.93, the number of drivers is only 78 people, and the total rides are 125. Thus, the rural cities have the highest average fare per ride which is $34.62 and highest average per driver that is $55.49.

In the line chart presented above we have a visual illustration of the numbers from the chart. 

## Summary

We can conclude that there is a direct relationship between the number of drivers and average fare per ride. I would recommend increasing the number of drivers in Rural cities to ensure there are enough drivers to meet ride demand.
